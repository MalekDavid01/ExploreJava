# ExploringJava
## A1- introduction to Java data structures
Contains implementation of 1. __EncryptionCesar__; 2.__irregular matrix__ using a 1D array which reformats based on the number of elements in the array and where the cell size is based on the maximum number of digits for the greatest number in the array; 3. Reading a file and registering how many letter __occurences__ there are.
## A2- Inheritance and polymorphism
1. __e-commerce__ data collection 2. __SubstitutionEncryption and EncryptionCesar__ implementation
## A3 - Stacks and queue utilities
Using __stack__ to implement base conversion and __queue__ to find the smallest multiple of an integer 'n' composed of only 9's and 0's
## A4 - Linked-List (singly linked, doubly linked, dummy node ...)
1. Creating a 'splitAfter' method that splits a doubly-linked list after a certain value. 2. A two-way iterator that loops a doubly-linked list 3. Using recursion which takes a stack and reverses the order of elements
